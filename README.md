# go-data-structures-algorithms

This repo is a place to practice data structures and algorithms and learning the Go/Golang programming language. The ultimate vision is that this project will demonstrate data structures and algorithms in the Go/Golang programming language. The main branch will include complete code for each data structure or algorithm, and a later branch will be added that will empty the implementation so others could download the code in some manner, and then implement their own code against our unit tests. 

## How to contribute 
1. Select a data-structure/algorithm
2. Create a branch for implementing your algorithm/data-structure
3. Update corresponding readme with instructions and with the basic information about the algorithm/datastructure
4. Implement the data structure and unit tests. (Be sure to clearly define the desired functionality for the test). 
5. Make a PR to merge this code into main whenever you are ready. 
6. Get the code reviewed and merged into main.
